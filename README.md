This is a repository that contains the source code for generating the lecture
notes, handouts, codes for the course (with the same title) offered at UIUC.

> This course provides a hands-on introduction to modern modeling and
simulations techniques for heterogeneous structures made of assemblies of soft,
elastic slender elements. Such systems are ubiquitous in nature, from animal
musculoskeletal architectures to ‘birds-nest’ composite materials. They are also
becoming increasingly relevant in robotics. Students will implement in python
their own Cosserat rods-based solver. The developed solver will be then coupled
with evolutionary optimization techniques for design, and reinforcement learning
for control.
