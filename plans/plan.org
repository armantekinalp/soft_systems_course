* Needs to be done
- Timestepper
- Traveling wave
- Elastica + CMA coupling : some examples
- Povray tutorial (document with povray setup)

* Future improvement (next semester)
- Some exercises on eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  - Like an ipynb notebook that illustrates eigenvalues for general matrices
  - Schedule after coding up the GA session?
- Add one more example forcing function (gravity) for example in the timestepper
demonstration

* Rough plans for lectures
** 01: Introduction to shell, setup python
** 02: Intro to Python + Jupyter notebook : Till lists
** 03: From lists to recursive functions
** 04: Functions to Classes + Modules. Transition to scicomp modules using intro to numpy
** 05: Scientific computing with Python : Demonstration through GA (Activity)
** 06: EigenX (Activity) + CMAes start (default settings + intution) (Theory)
** 07: CMAes finish + Rotations start (Theory)
** 08: More rotations (Activity)
** TODO 09: Finish rotations (Rodrigues) + Start timesteppers (theory)
** TODO 10: Timesteppers demo (activity, let them code up some timestepper)
** 11: Traveling wave demonstrations + snake intution (friction/contact)?
