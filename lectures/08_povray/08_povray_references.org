* Setup
  Installing ~PovRay~ is straightforward in a nix system. Some ways are:

  - If you are running ~Ubuntu~, you can install the ~PovRay~ executable and
	libraries using the ~apt~ module, like so:

   #+begin_src sh :exports code
	  # fetches up-to-date package information from
      #the ubuntu aptitude repository
	  sudo apt-get update

	  # upgrades all packages
	  sudo apt-get upgrade

	  # install python3, if not already there
	  sudo apt-get install povray
   #+end_src
	If you are running Windows, please use the Linux subsystem that you setup at
	the beginning of this semester to invoke the above commands.

  - If you are running other distros (~Debian~ etc.), invoke the appropriate package
	manager, with the same commands above.

  - Alternatively, if you are on ~MacOS~ or ~Linux~ based systems and are using
	~Homebrew/Linuxbrew~, then install ~PovRay~ using:
   #+begin_src sh :exports code
	 # install povray, if not already there
	 brew install povray
   #+end_src

* Tutorials
